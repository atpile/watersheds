This map shows how surface water flows in the United States.
</p>

<p>
When you tap on the map, the program highlights 
everything that is <i>upstream</i> from the point where you tap
in <i>red</i>, and all the <i>downstream</i> area in <i>blue</i>.
You can also pan around or zoom in or out on the map as usual.

</p>
The coloring is based on the level-12 watershed regions as published
by the US Geological Survey.  There are just over 100,000 of these
regions covering the United States; each one is a polygon defining
a local drainage basin that is five or ten miles or so across.  The data
in this program came from the <a
href="http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html">Watershed Boundary Dataset</a>,
which contains the geometry of the watershed regions and the flow
relationships between them.
</p>

</p>
The region that is immediately under the location where you tap
is drawn in yellow;
you might have to zoom in pretty far on the map to see it.  The red area
on the map shows all the regions that are upstream of the yellow one, and
the blue area shows all the retions that are downstream.
</p>

</p>
Some interesting things to note:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Most locations do not have much upstream (red) area.  The
  only locations with large upstream areas tend to be in or
  very near rivers.</li>
<li>Click on the Mississippi River near downtown New Orleans
  to see a huge example.</li>
<li>Notice how the drainage direction jumps from one side
  to the other as you move back and forth across the
  continental divides in both the eastern and western
  mountains.</li>
<li>Notice that there is a large area covering most of Nevada
  and the western part of Utah where the downstream
  drainage never makes it to an ocean.  This area
  is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Basin">Great Basin</a>.</li>
</ul>
